# Word Hunt Saga

## Introduction
Word Hunt Saga is a JavaFX-based game inspired by the popular Wordle game. It challenges players to guess a hidden Common word with a limited number of attempts. The game features a simple graphical interface and includes background music to enhance the gaming experience.

## Features
- **Interactive GUI**: A responsive and intuitive graphical user interface built with JavaFX.
- **Timed Gameplay**: Each game session is timed to increase the challenge.
- **Results Tracking**: Players' attempts and times are logged for future reference.
- **Dynamic Word Grid**: The game grid adjusts dynamically based on the word length and gameplay progress.
- **Sound Effects**: Includes media playback features to enhance user experience.

- JDK 11 or higher
- JavaFX SDK (compatible with your JDK version)
  
## How to Play
1. Start the game, and you will be greeted with a welcome message.
2. You must guess words that are 5 letters long. I might not have all of the 5 letter words in the English dictionary, but these are the "Most Common Words" that are used. 
3. Enter your guesses for the word and press "Enter" on your keyboard to input the word; you have five tries to guess the correct word. As well as a timer of 1 Min and 30 Sec
4. The game provides feedback on whether each guessed letter is in the target word and if it is in the correct position.
